      Repository", by clicking on it, you will be transferred to a new page titled, “Create a New Repository”. Here
      you will create a Repository name, and other options. By clicking the green button, “Create Repository”, your
      Repository will be ready to use.

      After your github setup has been completed in WebStorm, go to the VCS tab, and you will see the commit button with
      a green check mark next to it. It will lead you to a pop up called “Commit Changes” where you can select the files
      you wish to commit and add a commit message of what your task or edit was based on. After you have done that, you
      can press the blue commit button on the bottom right corner.

      message will appear once it is created to confirm the request.
